### 문제 설명

<p>The country of Oreste consists of exactly 25 cities labeled 'A' to 'Y'. There used to be a city labeled 'Z', but it is abandoned and we will not use it in this problem. Each pair of cities are connected by a road hence there are 300 roads in total. The president of Oreste wants Symeon to plan a patrolling strategy.</p>

<p>There are 100 riders that will cycle their bike to patrol along their planned route each night. To make it happened, the president of Oreste wants to make 100 "Triangle of Safety". "Triangle of Safety" is defined as a set of 3 different cities which has a road connecting each pair of them, i.e. a cycle of 3 cities, which will be a route for a patrolling rider. Obviously, these 100 "Triangle of Safety" must cover all roads.</p>

<p>Can you help Symeon?</p>
